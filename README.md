# DynamicPriorityScheduler
This project has been developed for working on the Wokwi Simulator, utilizing its hardware and software components.

The objective of this project is to create a effective and robust system that can dynamically adjust the priority orders in real-time, enabling the users take real-time factors into consideration and manually rearrange the tasks to ensure that the most optimal decision is made in the current scenario.

The ESP32 processor is utilized to run the program, along with additional hardware components such as keypad, LED, breadboard, all of which are provided by the Wokwi simulator.

FreeRTOS, a widely popular real-time operating system, along with its libraries is used for task managemtent at the lower level.It plays a very crucial role in handling the tasks throughout the entireity of the project.
